It is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City is home to nearly 18.5 million people in 2020, the immigrant population of New York is nearly 3.1m. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.\n\nThroughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \"melting pot\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\n\nWith it's diverse culture , comes diverse food items. There are many resturants in New york City, each beloning to different categories like Chinese , Indian , French etc.\n\nSo as part of this project , we will list and visualize all major parts of New York City that has great Indian Restaurants and which areas have a scope to open new Indian Restaurants."
